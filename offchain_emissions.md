# Offchain Emissions

## Company emissions
Maker DAO currently sends six remote Maker team members to attend approximately six conferences per year.

To account for conference attendance and air travel to those conferences, Flow Carbon averages the length of the conference and average flight distances for the remote-based team attending. Flow Carbon applies the latest emissions data to calculate the carbon resulting from the participation including: 

- round-trip air travel
- hotel accommodation
- the average length of the conference in the relevant business area
- local travel by car and train

... and other factors.

The results can always be enriched with more precise data to improve the calculation, but Flow Carbon is already at a great starting point to identify emissions sources throughout the organization and allocate them to the appropriate business area.

## Supplier emissions
Flow Carbon will account for the number of employees subscribed to and using these services during the calculation timeframe. Energy consumed on the end devices such as computers, phones, etc., as well server usage is taken into account to factor in supplier emissions. Some suppliers are already offsetting their emissions (e.g. some Google products), in which cases we do not take those into account.

## How to interpret the dataset
In general, it is important to note that all emissions resulting from the categories company and suppliers represent less than 1% of Maker DAOâ€™s total emissions. Given this extreme emission split and the comparably small allocation of CO2e to these two areas, we have worked with averages to calculate the carbon footprint of these two sections. In general the approach always considers higher rather than lower carbon estimations.

For emissions like conferences, flights, hotel nights, car rides etc. we have mainly used US or European data sources since those are usually higher than the global average. Also for supplier products, software and server emissions we have mainly worked with data from non-green energy sources and assumed extensive service usage. The goal here is to make sure that results are never under but when in doubt overestimated.
